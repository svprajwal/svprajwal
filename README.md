My name is Nikhil Premachandra rao, you can call me '**NIK**', a student at UmassD, tackling the wild journey of a Master's in Data Science. When I'm not decoding the secrets of machine learning, you'll catch me and my Python accomplice adding a dash of spice to the data realm because who said data couldn't be as flavorful as a good Indian curry? Let's turn those algorithms into comedy sketches and make data analysis a laughter-filled adventure! 🌶️🤖😄🐍📊

Skills: Python.
